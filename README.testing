The starting point to understand the build is shippable.yml

you need only docker installed to do the tests

To get into the testing environment, type

make testenv

to prepare for the tests, do

source tools/prepare

if you want to debug end-to-end tests, you can run

source tools/testenv

which givesyouawindow manager, and makes sure that after running a test you will be dropped to a python debugger
so you can inspect the browser using java console, inspector, etc

to run all test, just type

make checkall

this currently runs the unit/integration tests, and end-to-end tests using firefox and chrome
before make checkall, you do not want to source tools/testenv. if you did, unset E2EDEBUG

to run just the unit/integration tests, do

make tests

for end-to-end tests run

make onlyend2endtest

if you want to use your own browser, run

make handtest

to fire up an apache on ports 8888 (plain http) and 8889 (https), and a fake smtp server on port 1025

use

make killall

to bring down the hand test environment

to run one test, use tools/runone,with the test identifier as argument.
for example
./tools/runone HashE2ETest.HashTest.test_if_you_give_hash_after_registration_you_will_have_a_hashgiven_assurance

And of course more input validation tests are always welcome!
